Questions
1. how to initialize two dimensions' matrix with default value: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9318113/explicitly-assigning-values-to-a-2d-array

Test cases
1. empty
2. different lengths
3. true case
4. false case

Solution
1. naive method
scan and replace, use map (replaceMap) to keep track of the done replacement
false: new replacement would result in different replaceMap of the same key
true: replacement done and string equal

Point of attentions
1. mapping must be uniqe
2. one one mapping including same character
