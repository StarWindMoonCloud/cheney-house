				Leetcode question
				<ul>
					<li>  Subsets (Math solution)
						<pre>
Test case
1. empty
2. one element
3. normal
[1]
[2, 1]


number of subsets
n
(n, 1), (n, 2)
2^n

sort

from 1 ~ (2^n - 1)
choosing elements accordingly
output combination of nonzero bits 

Points of attention
sort first
not "put n - 1 - index-th value into output"
"^" is not for pow, it's bit operation

Method II
recursively add one more element to all the previous elements

[1,2,3]

j = 1

<pre>
if same with last, only append to those with same value at the back --> apply to the last one only --> if same with last, for the items with back same as last, append one to the last element --> if same with last, append to those last only appears once (the number added last round)
