Problem solving methodology
Start with (key) questions
Write down test cases
Solution part
Giving out my thinking
Write down general steps
Start from naive solution
How to optimize time and space?
Code according to the above framework
Manually testing, error correction and enhancement

Questions
1. java int[]: can the size be zero? Yes, new int[0]; can not be negative, will throw exception
2. array[]: definition as class?
like primitive, no definition found: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11573128/members-of-java-array-class
3. arraylist: size vs capacity, different values
4. same ratings must be same num of candies? No

Test cases
1. empty
2. all same ratings
3. various ratings
4. two min's

Solution
1. naive method
starting with min,
for each neighbor, if it's greater than min, more candy, ow, same candies
2. solution 1 is not correct, counter example: [1,2,4,4,3]
use valley/rising/descending
a. if valley, 1
b. if rising, prev candy + 1
c. descending: reverse and check
3. solution 2 is not correct, counter example: [4,2,3,4,1]
aa. sort (together with ranking)
a. starting with the current lowest rating
b. if neighbors are not assigned, assign it to 1, else go to c
c. compare with assigned neighbors
i. if equal to any of them: max(neighbors)
ii. if greater than all: max(neighbors)+1

Point of attentions
1. Need to be careful about each conversion
2. stack overflow??
3. do not overwrite original array
