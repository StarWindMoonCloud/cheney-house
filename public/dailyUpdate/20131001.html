Merge Two Sorted Lists

Testing
1. two empty lists
2. one empty: 
3. normal 
l1 1 4 5
l2 2 3
l1 1 2 4 5
l2 3

l1 2 3
l2 1 4 5
l1 1 2 3
l2 4 5

two pointers, merge the second one to the first one
p1, p2
p2 is small than p1, insert; ow p1++
separate head out

l1, l1->next
l2, l2->next

l1 2
l2 1

Points of attention
1. l1Pre != NULL and !l1Pre are different
2. insert and head operation need to be consistent
</pre>

						Plus One
						<pre>
digits plus one
treat both as binary

Testing:
1. empty
2. 0
3. 9
4. normal 123, 199

which is the least significant one??
suppose the rightest one --> leftmost one

perform plus
carrier+current, update currier

insert if carrier is not zero

Points of attention:
Use old value!

f(i): from 1 to i

f(n)

f(0)=0
f(1)=1
f(2)=2
f(3)

f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

Fibonacci

						Set Matrix Zeroes
						<pre>
Testing:
1. one element
2. one row (1 1 0 1)
3. one col
1
1
0
1
4. normal
1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1

naive method
use two matrices
1. copy matrix to res
2. go through and set zero

Time: O(m*n(m+n)); space: O(m*n)

use O(m+n) space
Time O(m*n)

space O(n)
current position <row, col> == 0
set the whole zeros, skip the row, record col 

in place
Use a special value (what are matrix values?)
current position <row, col> == 0
set the whole zeros, skip the row, set col value as -1
for each of the -1 values, set them to 0
But "Output Limit Exceeded"

						Minimum Window Substring
						<pre>
S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
T = "ABC"
"BANC"

Testing:
1. not found
"ADOB"
"AC"

2. found
"ADCB"
"AC"

S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
T = "ABC"

Question: any duplicate in T? suppose no

naive method
for each length greater then lenT, check if it is
time: O(m^2*n)

DP:

two pointers, hash to record the count of the pattern, if it's greater than 1, we can try to reduce len
countMap
1. find the first candidate/len, update countMap
S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
T = "ABC"
"ADOBEC"

2. if noway to further reduce the len of the candidate, move forward
else reduce length

Overall framework
a. find the first candidate, p1, p2; found? for each element: countMapCur >= countMapGoal
b. while (p2 != null) {
if (count == lenT) {

} else {

}
}

Points of attention
1. advance i need to update minStart, etc as well
2. need to update countMapCur when advance j
3. may be able to further reduce when j reaches to the end 
4. countMapCur is guarantee to updated

						<pre>
Testing
1. false
[
  ["ABCE"],
  ["SFCS"],
  ["ADEE"]
]
"ABCB"

flag
1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0

2. true
["a"]
a

two pointers, flag matrix
p1 
p2 (word)

checkBoard(vector<vector<char> > &board, vector<vector<int> > &flag, string word, int row, int col)
a. match the char, advance (checkBoard: right, down, left, up), mark flag
checkBoard(board, flag, wordNew, row+1)
remove flag
b. ow advance with same word
c. terminate
i. invalid row, col-> false;
ii. empty word->true;

Points of attention
1. need to check all position
2. if (word.length() == 0) return true; should be placed before the col, row check

						Remove Duplicates from Sorted List (II)
						<pre>
Testing
1. empty
2. one element
3. no duplicates 1->2->3
4. with duplicates 1->1->2->3->3

Sorted List
two pointers
cur == pre, delete cur
cur != pre, update pre
update cur

9:40pm
Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II 
1. empty
2. one element
3. no duplicates 1->2->3
4. with duplicates 1->1->2->3->3
1->1

three pointers 
pPre, pCur, pNext
pCur == pNext: delete 

dupPre, dupStart, dupEnd
pPre, pCur, pNext

pCur == pNext: 

duplicate happen when?
pPre, pCur, pNext
happen: 
pPre != pCur == pNext
delete pCur, update pCur, pNext
end: 
pPre == pCur != pNext
delete pPre, pCur, update pPre, pCur, pNext

naive method
pPre, pCur
pStart, pEnd
delete, update pPre, pCur

Points of attention
1. the last part of duplicates
2. undefined and NULL are different, when deleted, assigned it NULL (pPre = NULL;)
3. pPre = pStartPre when deleted
