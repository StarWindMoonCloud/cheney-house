				Palindrome Partitioning II
						<pre>
Test case
1. empty
2. one element
3. normal length
a. isP
b. not p

f(i): min cut from 0-i
suppose minCut of before i is computed
f(i)=min(f(j) + 1) when isP(s[j+1 to i])

Points of attention
isP DP: len should be the out loop
the whole string is P: j==0, dp[i] = 0, break;
</pre>
			</li>
			<li> Gas Station
<pre>
Test case:
1. empty station
2. one station
3. two/more stations


Questions:
1. if there're multiple indices that satisfy the condition, which to return
2. what does the circle look like? 0->1->2->3->...->n-1->0
3. direction? clock and counter-clock?

naive method
check each station as starting point
for each nod
if(sum(g[0-i]) >= sum[c[0 to i]])

Time: O(n^2)


O(n)?
As long as sum(g) >= sum(c), there exists a choice
Start at any point, and compute the gap

l[i]: gas left when arrives at station i
find a way so that l[i] >= 0 for all i

gap[i]: gap considering from i to i+1 
gap[i] = g[i] - c[i]

Points of attention
1. starting point is start
2. clear left for each new round

How to refine

DP
update index when is not positive, alway keep the first index that can keep positive all the time
</pre>
			</li>
			<li> Single Number && Single Number II
<pre>
use XOR

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(int A[], int n) {
        assert(n > 0);
        int res = A[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            res ^= A[i];
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};

Single Number II
Test case
1. empty
2. 1 number
3. 4 numbers
4. other

why XOR works for two same number, cause it's binary
Need some operation, when 3 same digit applied -> 0

count number of each bit
Points of attention
1. shift may suffer for minus number
2. determine if a bit is 1: (A[j] >> i) & 1; mush have "& 1"
3. twos need to go first, ow ones would be updated first

use ones, twos, threes
ones: combination value of all bits that appear once
twos: combination value of all bits that appear twice
threes: combination value of all bits that appear three times
only need to worry about bits whose value is 1
