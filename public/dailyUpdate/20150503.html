Repeated DNA Sequences

Questions

Test cases
1. empty
2. no valid
3. with nonempty result: "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Solution
1. naive method: for each one, check if it's valid and put it to set, time: O(n^2*10), space: O(m)
2. via map: use map to store the count of each 10-seq, and output those with value greater than 1 to list, time: O(n), space: O(n*10)

Point of attentions
1. intToStrSeq: must meet length 10
2. strToInt, intToStr: verify value stays the same after two operations
