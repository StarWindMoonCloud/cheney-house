        Add and Search Word - Data structure design
						<pre>
Problem solving methodology
Start with (key) questions
Write down test cases
Solution part
Giving out my thinking
Write down general steps
Start from naive solution
How to optimize time and space?
Code according to the above framework
Manually testing, error correction and enhancement

Add and Search Word

Questions
1. how to store the words
2. how to support search with pattern
3. java public class, default scope of member, constructor, uninitialized map value, get class value, empty subStr?
4. match dot, how to advance? recursively

Test cases
1. empty word
2. no match
3. with nondot pattern match
4. with doc pattern match

Solution
1. naive method
put all words into set, search is traversal. Time: add O(1); search O(n); Space O(n)
2. via tree

Point of attentions
1. internal class variable as function parameter is not a good idea
2. init trie not with null map, but empty one. Cause reference assign may loss connection
3. root do not advance pattern word

Key points
1. add: match via map, set lastNode's isEnd
2. search: match and advance via map, check via node's isEnd
