Problem solving methodology
Start with (key) questions
Write down test cases
Solution part
Giving out my thinking
Write down general steps
Start from naive solution
How to optimize time and space?
Code according to the above framework
Manually testing, error correction and enhancement

Questions

Test cases
1. empty
2. one row
3. no surrouneded case
4. with no surrouneded case
5. all 'X' and all 'O'

Solution
1. naive method
For each '0', check if it's surrounded, if so, change.
Time: O(mn(m+n)), space: O(c)
2.
a. found connected areas and marked with island number
b. for each area, check if all item is surrounded
if so, it should be captured
3. edge is crucial, check boundaries
a. all 'X', kill all '0'
b. for any '0', expand, and mark safe
c. go through and kill those are not marked safe

Point of attentions
1. two dimension matrix, use length
2. stack overflow
