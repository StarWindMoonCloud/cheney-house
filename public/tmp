naive method
for each valid <point, width, height>, check if it's all one,
if yes, update maxArea
(x,y), width, height : (m*n)^3

advanced method
reduce it to one dimension

find the max are given the one dimension data

for i-th element
suppose hight = v[i]
what's the max width?

== or going up: w++, update preh
going down: calculate the preMaxArea, w=1,
